# Paper VIII — Frequencies of the Quasi-Radial Modes of an $n=3/2$ Polytrope (Hartle & Friedman 1975)

**PDF:** [VIII.pdf](sandbox:/mnt/data/VIII.pdf)

## Aim
Evaluate the **rotation-induced frequency shifts** (from Paper VI) for a full **$n=3/2$ polytropic sequence**, and **cross-check** alternative derivations (e.g., Chandrasekhar & Friedman) for internal consistency.

## Method
1. Compute the non-rotating **radial eigenfunctions** and frequencies.  
2. Build the slow-rotation background (Paper I): frame dragging + $\ell=0$ second order.  
3. Insert into the **Paper VI functional** for $[\omega^2]^{(2)}$ and evaluate numerically along the sequence.  
4. Compare with the independent expression (Chandrasekhar–Friedman)—they **agree** within numerical accuracy.

## Results
- Rotation produces **predictable, small** shifts in the fundamental and low-order quasi-radial mode frequencies for $n=3/2$.  
- The agreement between two long, structurally different formulas validates the **perturbative machinery**.

## Takeaway
Paper VIII provides a **numerical benchmark** for mode-frequency shifts in the slow-rotation regime and demonstrates **methodological robustness** across derivations.
